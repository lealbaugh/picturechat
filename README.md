picturechat
===========

Uses Socket.io with a simple static NodeJS server and client-side JS to provide an image-only chat interface.  The responsive layout is generated with Sass.

Supports easy addition of more icon images without rewriting the code: on page load, the client uses the socket to request a list of all available icons in the server's assets directory.
